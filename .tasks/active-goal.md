# Active Goal: AI Go Tutor Improvement

Objective: Keep improving this AI go tutor until it becomes truly inspiring and useful.

Current branch: `codex/go-sensei-learning-foundation`

Current PR: draft PR #24

Working approach:
- Keep changes learner-facing and evidence-driven.
- Probe local guided questions before adding new router behavior.
- Add focused failing tests before implementation.
- Verify with unit tests, static checks, build, and browser smoke when behavior reaches the UI.

Latest completed slice:
- Added local guided answers for second-objective questions around tenuki, playing away, sente, defending first, keeping the extension plan, and center play after a corner anchor.
- Verified the slice with the full unit suite, typecheck, lint, build, and browser smoke.
- Fixed guided-game routing so learning path, dashboard, and Sensei guided-game actions restore a true guided 9x9 board instead of returning to a stale non-guided game.
- Fixed the Sensei bubble typewriter so guided-game coaching text appears after React Strict Mode replays the initial effect.
- Added local attack-vs-defense decisions so guided learners get a board-specific priority call during simple fights.

Next investigation candidates:
- Later guided positions where opponent pressure, follow-up cuts, or capture races should be explained in even more natural beginner language.
- Whether the guided 9x9 entry should preserve a paused guided board across app reloads more explicitly than the current session store does.
